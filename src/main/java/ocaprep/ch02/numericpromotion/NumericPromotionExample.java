	 * numeric promotion rules
	 * 
	 * 1. if two values have different data types, Java will automatically promote one of the values to the larger of the two data types
	 * 2. if one of the values is integral and the other is floating-point, Java will automatically promote the integeral value to the floating-point value's data type
	 * 3. smaller data types, namely byte, short, and char, are first promoted to int any time they're used with a Java binary arithmetic operator, even if neither of teh operands is int
	 * 		3.1 byte
	 * 		3.2 short
	 * 		3.3 char
	 * 4. after all promotion has occurred and the operands have the same data type, the resulting value will have teh same data type as its promoted operands
